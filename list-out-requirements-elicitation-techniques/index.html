Web requirements elicitation , also designated as requirements discovery, capture, recollection, acquisition, or extraction, is a task that involves several activities that should permit requirements engineers, jointly with the stakeholders, to understand what are the requirements of a given system.</p><h2>In This Phase, Requirements Engineers Gather The Requirements Of The Software Under Development From Users, Stakeholders And.</h2><br/><p>Web requirements elicitation is a critical activity that forms part of the requirements engineering process because it has to discover what the software must do through a solid understanding of the wishes and needs of the various stakeholders and to transform them into software requirements. Web the survey elicitation technique is the preferred elicitation technique when faced with many stakeholders or when stakeholders are geographically dispersed, and you need to gather the same information from them.
