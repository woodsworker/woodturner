Although against motion is most commonly seen, you would see with motion if the myopic value is within the working distance, and you can see no motion if the myopic value is exactly the working distance. Each student&#039;s working distance and compensation lens are calculated individually, maximizing the distance and continuously monitoring it during training.</p><h2>Web Works Much Better With An Optical Bench Than With A Human Eye.</h2><br/><p>Web in retinoscopy, the working distance refers to the distance between the patient’s eye and the retinoscope, which is the instrument used to evaluate the refractive error of the eye. When conducting the retinoscopy procedure, get started by asking your patient to fixate on an object or a place in the distance.
